\title{Drops Any Rows With Large Weight Reductions}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the columns to evaluate.}

\item{...}{Columns containing weight measurements. At least two columns must be specified.}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value specifying the percentage reduction threshold. Defaults to 20.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\item{Cleaned_Data}{A data frame with rows exceeding the threshold removed.}
\item{Dropped_Summary}{A data frame summarizing rows that were removed, including
the columns involved in the reduction and the calculated percentage reduction.}

Detects and removes rows where the mouse trial weight decreases dramatically across columns

\details{
Drop Large Weight Reductions

Identifies and removes rows where the percentage reduction in weight between
consecutive weighings exceeds a specified threshold (default: 20%).

This function calculates the percentage weight reduction between specified columns,
flags rows exceeding the threshold, and returns a cleaned dataset along with a summary
of dropped rows.

\examples{
# Example dataset
data <- data.frame(
  Mouse_ID = 1:5,
  Weight_Day1 = c(50, 60, 55, 45, 40),
  Weight_Day2 = c(45, 50, 40, 40, 35),
  Weight_Day3 = c(40, 48, 38, 38, 30)
)

# Drop rows with a weight reduction greater than 20\% between days
result <- drop_large_weight_reductions(data, Weight_Day1, Weight_Day2, Weight_Day3, threshold = 20)

# View cleaned data
result$Cleaned_Data

# View dropped rows summary
result$Dropped_Summary
